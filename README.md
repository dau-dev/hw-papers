# Hardware Papers
Collection of hardware papers I find interesting/important. Some software papers are included if they are relevant to hardware accelerators.

Organized by topic. Will reorganize as I go.

## Simulation/Modeling
**Analyzing Behavior Specialized Acceleration**  
*T Nowatzki, K Sankaralingam*, ASPLOS 2016 [[link]](http://research.cs.wisc.edu/vertical/papers/2016/asplos16-exocore.pdf)

## Memory Hierarchy
**The Direct-to-Data (D2D) cache: navigating the cache hierarchy with a single lookup**  
*A. Sembrant, E. Hagersten, D. Black-Schaffer*, ISCA 2014 [[link]](https://www.it.uu.se/katalog/andse541/isca14-final.pdf)
